# marketApp
This is the market app that is a project for market analysis

# Outline
## Create a viable Dataset
I made a function to produce the data that I will be testing the app with.

The function produces a new random data set each time I run it. And I am  
able to get a full range of datasets with this function.

## Create the App
Now I need to make the app that will take a amount of money to be invested  
and then either buy or sell a percentage when the market goes up or down  
respectively. 

The idea behind the app is that it works off of percentages. If the market  
goes down a little, you use a small percentage of the money invested to buy  
some stock. Likewise if the market goes up, then you will sell a small  
percentage of the amount that is currently invested.  

## Aspects

### Money to Invest
### Ratio of Percentages
### What happens when the majority of the money is invested?
